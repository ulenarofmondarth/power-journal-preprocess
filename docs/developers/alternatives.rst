Alternatives
============


.. _replacing pnpm:
Can I use ``npm`` instead of ``pnpm``?
--------------------------------------

Replacing ``pnpm`` with ``npm`` is simple enough. You will need to modify the following:

``package.json``
  Change the ``packageManager`` entry, remove the ``scripts.preinstall`` entry. Check for any embedded ``pnpm`` commands and replace with the corresponding ``npm`` command. Most day-to-day 'heavy lifting' is done with :ref:`zx scripts` and these are independent of the package manager in use.
``.github/workflows``
  Check these as they use ``pnpm`` and a github cache action for ``pnpm``.

.. _replacing github:
Can I use an alternative to ``github``?
---------------------------------------

You can use another host for your version control and deployment but you will need to review and update:

``.github/workflows``
  These (obviously) rely on github being used\ [#F1]_. These build, package and deploy your module and its associated documentation.
``module.json``
  The elements in this file that change with each release are automatically maintained by the ``.github/workflows``. You will need to implement alternatives if you choose another host.


.. _replacing sphinx:
Can I replace the documentation system?
---------------------------------------

This project uses Docker to isolate a documentation system based on `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_. The ``.github/workflows`` assume this documentation system is used when building and deploying the documentation to :program:`github pages`.

If you replace the documentation system you will need to review and update:

``.github/workflows/buid_and_release_docs.yml``
  This is responsible for the release build of documentation and publishing to :program:`github pages`.
``package.json``
  Update (or remove) the ``serve:docs`` and ``devserve:docs`` script entries.
``scripts``
  Update (or remove) the scripts invoked from ``package.json``.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#F1] Well, at least something that understands Github actions and workflow format. Try `act <https://github.com/nektos/act>`_, this can be usefull for local testing of workflows. It is also the workflow system used by `Gitea <https://about.gitea.com/>`_ (if you fancy an alternative web-based repository host).
